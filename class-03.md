## Q1- The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block

## Q2- The main difference between the two methods is that read() reads the entire contents of a file or a specified number of bytes, while readline() reads one line of the file at a time
## Q3- an exception is a runtime error that occurs when the program encounters an unexpected situation. Exception handling is the process of catching and handling these errors in a way that allows the program to continue running smoothly.

## The try, except, and finally blocks are used to handle exceptions in Python. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block contains the code that handles the exception if it occurs. The finally block contains code that is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
