# Q1
in Python, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the attributes and methods of an object, while an object is an instance of a class. Here are the key differences between classes and objects in Python
# Q2
Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case. The base case is a condition that, when met, terminates the recursion and returns a value. Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems that involve repetitive or recursive tasks, such as traversing trees, searching algorithms, and sorting algorithms.

def factorial(n):

if n == 0:

return 1

else:

return n * factorial(n-1)

Pytest fixtures are a way to provide a fixed baseline for testing by providing test data and objects to a test function. Fixtures can be used to set up a test environment and provide resources that are required for testing, such as database connections, web servers, and mock objects. Fixtures can be created by defining a function with the @pytest.fixture decorator, and can be used in test functions by including them as a parameter.

Code coverage is a metric that measures how much of the code is executed by a test suite. Code coverage can be used to identify untested code and to ensure that the tests are comprehensive and cover all branches of the code. Code coverage is calculated by measuring the percentage of code lines executed by the tests.
