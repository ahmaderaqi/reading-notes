A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains a reference to the next node in the list. It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.

In contrast to an array, where elements are stored contiguously in memory, the nodes of a linked list can be scattered throughout memory. This makes a linked list more flexible than an array because it can be easily resized and rearranged.

Linked lists are used to implement dynamic data structures such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

here's a diagram that illustrates the linked list data structure

    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+
    | Node  |    | Node  |    | Node  |    | Node  |
    |   1       |    |   2        |    |   3        |    |   4   |
    |-------| -> |-------| -> |-------| -> |-------| -> NULL
    | data  |    | data  |    | data  |    | data  |
