# Q1
In Python, variable scope refers to the region of a program where a variable can be accessed or referenced. The scope of a variable is determined by where it is defined in the code and can be either local or global.

A variable that is defined inside a function has local scope and can only be accessed within the function. Once the function is finished executing, the variable is destroyed and its value cannot be accessed outside the function. On the other hand, a variable that is defined outside of a function has global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including within functions.

# Q2
In Python, the global and nonlocal keywords are used to modify the scope of variables and to access variables that are defined in outer scopes.

The global keyword is used inside a function to indicate that a variable is a global variable, which means that it should be accessed from the global scope rather than the local scope. When you use the global keyword, any assignment to the variable within the function will affect the global variable, rather than creating a new local variable.

Big O notation is a way of describing the time complexity of an algorithm, which is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input data increases. It is a mathematical way of expressing how much time and space an algorithm needs to solve a problem of a particular size.

The purpose of Big O notation is to provide a standardized way of describing the performance of algorithms, regardless of the programming language used to implement them or the specific hardware or software environment in which they are run. This allows developers to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and to make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a particular problem.

Big O notation is important in the context of algorithm analysis because it allows us to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in a consistent and standardized way. By expressing the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O notation, we can determine how quickly the algorithm will be able to solve a problem of a given size, and we can also identify which parts of the algorithm are the most time-consuming and may need to be optimized.

In summary, Big O notation is a way of analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and comparing them to each other. It provides a standardized and consistent way of describing the performance of algorithms, regardless of the programming language or specific hardware and software environment. By using Big O notation, developers can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a particular problem and can identify areas of an algorithm that may need to be optimized for better performance.

# Q4
o simulate a dice roll using Python, we can use the random module, which provides a function called randint that generates a random integer between two given values. To simulate a dice roll, we can use randint to generate a random integer between 1 and 6, which corresponds to the six possible outcomes of a single dice roll.
