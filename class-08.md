## Q1-


The basic syntax of Python list comprehension is:

`new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]`

where `expression` is the operation to be performed on each item in the iterable, `item` is the variable that represents each item in the iterable, `iterable` is the collection of items to be iterated over, and `condition` is an optional expression that specifies a condition for which items to include in the new list. 

Using a for loop to create a list is a more traditional approach where we declare an empty list and then use a for loop to iterate over an iterable and append items to the list one by one. The list comprehension provides a more concise and readable way to create a new list in a single line of code. 

Here is an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)



In this example, we start with a list of integers `numbers`, and we use a list comprehension to create a new list `squared_numbers` by squaring each item in `numbers`. The resulting list will be `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`. 

To compare, here's an equivalent implementation using a for loop:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = []
for num in numbers:
    squared_numbers.append(num ** 2)
print(squared_numbers)



Both implementations produce the same output, but the list comprehension provides a more concise and readable syntax.




##  Q2-


In Python, a decorator is a special type of function that can be used to modify or extend the behavior of another function, method or class without changing its source code. Decorators are essentially wrappers around functions that allow you to add new features or behavior to them.

The basic syntax for using a decorator is as follows:

@decorator_function
def some_function():
    # Function body



Here, the `@decorator_function` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `some_function` function. The decorator function itself takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that can add additional behavior to the original function.

For example, let's say we want to add a feature that logs the time taken by a function to execute. We can create a decorator function to do this:


import time

def time_it(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken by {func.__name__}: {end - start} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper



Here, the `time_it` function is a decorator that takes a function `func` as an argument and returns a new function `wrapper` that logs the time taken by `func` to execute. The `wrapper` function takes any number of positional and keyword arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`.

We can now use the `time_it` decorator to add the time logging feature to any function we want. For example:


@time_it
def some_function():
    # Function body



Now, when we call `some_function`, the decorator will automatically log the time taken by the function to execute. This is just one example of how decorators can be used to add new features or behavior to functions without changing their original source code.




## Q3-


In Python, a decorator is a function that takes another function as input, performs some operation on it, and returns a new function as output. Decorators are used to modify or enhance the behavior of existing functions or classes, without actually modifying their source code. 

The basic syntax for a decorator is as follows:

@decorator_function
def original_function():
    # Function body



Here, `decorator_function` is the name of the decorator function that will be applied to `original_function`. When the program is run, `original_function` will be executed with the behavior defined by the decorator.

Decorators are often used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, error handling, or authentication. For example, suppose we have a function that we want to log every time it is called. We can define a decorator function to log the function call as follows:

```python
def log_function_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

Here, `log_function_call` is the decorator function that takes the original function `func` as input, and returns a new function `wrapper` that first logs the function call and then calls the original function. The `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax allows `wrapper` to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments.

We can now apply the `log_function_call` decorator to any function we want to log:

@log_function_call
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Function body



Now, when `my_function` is called, the decorator will automatically log the function call before executing the function.

Overall, decorators are a powerful and flexible tool in Python for modifying the behavior of existing functions or classes. They allow you to separate cross-cutting concerns from the main functionality of a program, making it easier to write and maintain code.
