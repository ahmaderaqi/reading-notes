# Stacks and queues

Stacks and queues are data structures commonly used in computer science and programming. 

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item removed. You can think of a stack as a pile of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top. The main operations of a stack are push, which adds an item to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top item from the stack.

A queue, on the other hand, is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, which means that the first item added to the queue will be the first item removed. You can think of a queue as a line of people waiting to buy tickets, where the first person in line will be the first person served. The main operations of a queue are enqueue, which adds an item to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the front item from the queue.

Both stacks and queues are useful in many programming applications. For example, a stack can be used to keep track of function calls in a program, while a queue can be used to implement a task scheduler or a message queue.
