# What is a Tree Data Structure in Python?

A Tree is a Data structure in which data items are connected using references in a hierarchical manner. Each Tree consists of a root node from which we can access each element of the tree. Starting from the root node, each node contains zero or more nodes connected to it as children. A simple binary tree can be depicted as seen in the following figure.


## binary tree
A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.


## binary search tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
