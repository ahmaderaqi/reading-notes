A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient retrieval and insertion operations. It is widely used in computer science and offers constant-time average case complexity for these operations, making it highly efficient for large datasets.

In a hash table, the keys are hashed to generate an index or position within an array-like data structure called a hash table or hash map. This index is used to store the associated value in the hash table. The key is used as a unique identifier to locate and retrieve the corresponding value.

Here are some important characteristics and concepts related to hash tables:

Hash Function:
A hash function is a crucial component of a hash table. It takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code. The hash function should efficiently map keys to a range of indices within the hash table to distribute the key-value pairs evenly.

Collision Resolution:
Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash value, resulting in the same index within the hash table. Hash tables employ various collision resolution techniques to handle these collisions effectively. Two common techniques are chaining and open addressing.

Chaining:
In chaining, each index or bucket in the hash table stores a linked list or other data structure to handle collisions. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is appended to the existing list at that index. This allows multiple key-value pairs with the same hash value to coexist at the same index.

Open Addressing:
In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm probes the next available index in the hash table until an empty slot is found. The probing sequence can follow different strategies such as linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing. The advantage of open addressing is that it avoids the additional memory overhead of storing linked lists for collision resolution.

Load Factor:
The load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is. It is defined as the ratio of the number of key-value pairs in the hash table to the total number of slots. A higher load factor increases the chance of collisions and may degrade performance. To maintain efficiency, hash tables are often resized when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.

Resize and Rehash:
To handle changes in the number of key-value pairs and maintain a balanced load factor, hash tables are dynamically resized when necessary. When a resize occurs, the hash table is expanded or shrunk, and all existing key-value pairs are rehashed and redistributed across the new table.

Time Complexity:
Hash tables offer efficient time complexity for key-based operations. On average, the time complexity for insertion, retrieval, and deletion is O(1), assuming a good hash function and a well-distributed set of keys. In the worst case, when collisions are frequent or the hash function is poorly designed, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table.
